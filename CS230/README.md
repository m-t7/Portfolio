### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Agile teams interpret user needs and implement them into a program by gathering requirements through interviews and surveys, create user personas, and define user stories that translate into specific features. These features/stories are then prioritized and iteratively developed, with regular testing and validation to ensure they meet user needs.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developers approach developing programs by starting with planning and design, then implementing features incrementally with continuous integration and rigorous testing. I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as Scrum for sprint organization and Kanban for workflow visualization, ensuring continuous feedback and improvement.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Communicating clearly and frequently with to team members, stakeholders, and product owners is a vital ability for a good team member in software development.
Additionally, taking accountability for tasks, demonstrating empathy for others, and working in a collaborative/adapatable fashion are all traits of good software development team members.
