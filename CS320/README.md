**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I test frequently using both manual and automated methods. I also validate inputs, handle expected errors, and validate edge cases through automated testing.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I listenin to feedback and consider the client's needs and ultimate goals to turn that into functional software features. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

I plan ahead by breaking the project into small tasks and sketching out the structure. Ironing out the key points of functionality and focusing on maintainability helps me design clean, fucntioning software.
