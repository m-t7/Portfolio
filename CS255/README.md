### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client, DriverPass, is a company focused on helping students prepare for driving tests. They wanted a system that provides online practice exams, scheduling for on-the-road training, and progress tracking features to improve student success rates.

### What did you do particularly well?

I was able to identify the non-functional requirements and design accurate UML diagrams depicting the use cases and flow of the DriverPass system.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revice the functional requirement section of the business requirements document from project 1. One of the requirements I listed was a non-functional requirement, which should not have been included in that section.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by designing a system that supports key features like practice exams, training scheduling, and progress tracking to help students prepare for their exams. The user’s needs are crucial to ensure the system is intuitive, functional, and meets the goal of improving student success rates.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I start by understanding user needs, defining acceptance criteria, and mapping out functionality with diagrams. In the future, I'll use Agile methodologies for iterative design and continuous feedback to refine the system.
