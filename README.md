### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

By taking ample time to understand the client's requirements and design constraints, I was able to weigh the pros and cons of certain architectural designs/software infrastucture 
and determine the design that best met the client and end-user's needs.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It is important to consider a user's needs when designing software as the entire application is built entirely for the end-consumers to utilize. Optimizing 
their experience is often the quickest path to customer retention and consistent revenue.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would improve this document by increasing the brevity of the 'executive summary' portion.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Crafting a design document was extremely helpful during development as the requirements and design constraints were clearly
laid out in an easy-interpretable manner. This streamlined the development process.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I accurately identified the requirements necessary for developing an acceptable MVP (Minimum viable product) for the client's request. This aided me greatly
when determining the optimal software solutions that could be used to finish the project. 

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based, multi-platform version of their existing game; ‘Draw it or Lose It’- currently only available on Android. 
Additionally, Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name, Game instances cannot be duplicated but may potentially be shared across platforms,
and the application must support the core game functionality and provide a consistent, seamless experience to users regardless of their operating platform.
