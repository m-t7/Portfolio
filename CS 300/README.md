**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
The problem was designing a C++ program that reads course data from a file, stores it in a data structure, and allows users to interact with it through a menu to view, sort, and search for course information.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**  
I started by breaking down the problem and assessing how certain data structures could be beneficial for the project's specific requirements. After performing a runtime analysis and evaluating different approaches in pseudocode, I selected the appropriate date structure and implemented the code accordingly.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
I overcame roadblocks by breaking the project into smaller tasks, such as first getting the file reading and data structure to work, then focusing on menu functionality and sorting, troubleshooting step by step as needed.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
The project expanded my approach by reinforcing the importance of planning data flow, choosing the right data structures, and implementing error handling.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
The project taught me to write modular code, use consistent naming conventions, add clear comments, and handle errors properly, all of which enhance the programâ€™s readability, maintainability, and adaptability.
