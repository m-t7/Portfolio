## How do I approach designing software?

I start by breaking the project into smaller, manageable pieces and outlining the main components. I sketch out the structure and decide how each part will interact, focusing on clarity and maintainability. Planning ahead helps me stay organized and ensures the final product is both clean and functional.

## How do I approach developing programs?

I build my programs step by step, starting with core features and gradually adding complexity. As I test the software, I make adjustments based on what works and what doesn’t. Keeping my code modular and well-commented makes it easier to debug and expand later.

Iteration was a big part of my process. I would implement a feature, test it, and then refine it based on the results. If something didn’t look or work right, I would go back, adjust the code, and try again. This cycle of building, testing, and improving helped me gradually achieve the results I wanted.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computational graphics taught me to solve complex problems visually, think spatially, and use math creatively. I learned to model objects, add lighting and textures, and write clean, reusable code — skills useful for building interactive applications in many fields.

Computer science gives me the tools to solve problems and create solutions that matter to me. By learning how to design and build software, I can automate tasks, bring my ideas to life, and open up new career opportunities in technology and beyond.
